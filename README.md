# Sump Room Monitor

Source code for my Sump Room Monitor which runs on a generic ESP8266 board and uses Pushover for notifications.

This is still a work in process.

## Credits

- Notifications are done using the Pushover library by Arduino Hannover: https://github.com/ArduinoHannover/Pushover
- WiFi Setup based on: https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/latest/esp8266wifi/readme.html
